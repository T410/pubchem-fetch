It has a role as a human metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a cofactor. It is a nitrogen hydride, an onium cation and a monovalent inorganic cation. It is a conjugate acid of an ammonia.","Inorganic compounds that include a positively charged tetrahedral nitrogen (ammonium ion) as part of their structure.
