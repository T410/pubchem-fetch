    "PhysicalDescription": [
        "Ammonia solutions (containing more than 35% but not more than 50% ammonia) appears as a clear colorless liquid consisting of ammonia dissolved in water. Corrosive to tissue and metals. Although ammonia is lighter than air, the vapors from a leak will initially hug the ground. Long term exposure to low concentrations or short term exposure to high concentrations may result in adverse health conditions from inhalation. Prolonged exposure of containers to fire or heat may result in their violent rupturing and rocketing.",
        "Ammonia, anhydrous appears as a clear colorless gas with a strong odor. Shipped as a liquid under its own vapor pressure. Density (liquid) 6 lb / gal. Contact with the unconfined liquid can cause frostbite. Gas generally regarded as nonflammable but does burn within certain vapor concentration limits and with strong ignition. Fire hazard increases in the presence of oil or other combustible materials. Although gas is lighter than air, vapors from a leak initially hug the ground. Prolonged exposure of containers to fire or heat may cause violent rupturing and rocketing. Long-term inhalation of low concentrations of the vapors or short-term inhalation of high concentrations has adverse health effects. Used as a fertilizer, as a refrigerant, and in the manufacture of other chemicals.   Rate of onset: Immediate  Persistence: Minutes  Odor threshold: 17 ppm  Source/use/other hazard: Explosives manufacture; pesticides; detergents industry.",
